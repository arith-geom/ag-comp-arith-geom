Böckle, C.V. SriramThe study of algebraic groups constitutes a prominant place in mathematical sciences today, having applications in fields such as algebraic geometry, number theory and mathematical physics. This seminar is about one of the building blocks of these groups the affine algebraic groups. We will mainly follow the self contained book of W.C. Waterhouse ``Introduction to Affine Group Schemes'' during the seminar.&nbsp; The seminar commences on October 25th, 2022 and will be held every Tuesday from 11 AM to 1PM. The location is INF 205. The lecture hall is SR3.The Vorbesprechung will be held on September 30, 2022 from 2 PM to 4 PM; SR2, INF 205Here you will find the announcement of the seminar: Announcement.A detailed description of the talks and also the practicalities of the seminar can be found here.A template(LaTeX file) for creating handout is available here (There are two ways of compiling this file :-(i) using the online editor https://www.overleaf.com/&nbsp; or (ii) downloading a LaTeX editor and compiler.
