One source of such representations is the p-adic etale cohomology of varieties over a number field. The perhaps best known example that fits this description is the Tate module attached to an elliptic curve, or an abelian variety. Another rich source are modular (or more generally algebraic automorphic) forms. Starting with Eichler and Shimura there was a growing expectation that many such representations that arise from geometry also arise from automorphic forms; then the representation would be called modular. A first truly spectacular consequence of this philosophy was Wiles proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem (FLT), completed together with Taylor in 1995. They proved that any semistable elliptic curve `was’ modular. Still before Wiles, in the 1980s Serre formulated conjectures on absolutely irreducible 2-dimensional odd Galois representations of the absolute Galois group of Q with coefficients in finite fields, namely that they should all arise from modular forms. This would also give a proof of FLT, and these conjectures of Serre are now a theorem of Khare and Wintenberger from around 2007. The course will give an introduction to the theme
