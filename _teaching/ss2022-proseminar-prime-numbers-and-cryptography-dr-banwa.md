V. Sriram&nbsp;Termine: April 11-14 2022Wo: SR8 and onlineFormat: Block SeminarAnnouncement: click hereProgram: click hereVorbesprechung slides: click here Thema:This seminar will develop some of the theory that lies behind these real-world applications, via a hands-on, algorithmic approach: Fast arithmetic in Z/nZ, complexity analysis, and probabilistic methods will be treated along with the number field sieve, a technique arising from algebraic number theory. The analogues of these in the elliptic curve setting will also be seen.See the course announcement and program (linked above) for more information.&nbsp; &nbsp;TalksGrey indicates that the talk is also suitable for a Seminar talk.TitleSpeakerDateTimeHandoutPrime numbers and Complexity analysisEtienne Stock11.4.202209:15click hereFast arithmetic I : Fourier Transform AlgorithmsJonas Höcht11.4.202211:00click herePseudoprimes and the Miller-Rabin testPhilipp Nazari11.4.202214:15click hereThe Theorem of Agrawal-Kayal-Saxena ICarola Behr12.4.202209:15click hereThe Theorem of Agrawal-Kayal-Saxena IISaif Mandour12.4.202211:00click hereBrief overview of Algebraic number theoryVincent Zahlen12.4.202214:15click hereFactorisation III - The number field sieveC.
