title: Welcome to AG Computational Arithmetic Geometry
---

Welcome to the research group "Computational Arithmetic Geometry" at the Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing (IWR) in Heidelberg.

Our research focuses on Galois representations, modular forms, elliptic curves, and function field arithmetic. We combine theoretical methods with computational approaches using computer algebra to advance our understanding of arithmetic geometry.
