# 1. Getting Started

This section explains how to access the website management interface and the basics of how it works.

## 🔑 How to Log In

1.  Go to **[https://pagescms.org](https://pagescms.org)**.
2.  Click **"Sign in with GitHub"**.
2. **Note: You can also be invited by a member in PagesCMS.**
3.  Select the repository for the website (e.g., `arith-geom/ag-comp-arith-geom`).

Once logged in, you will see the **Dashboard**.

## 👥 Managing Users (Inviting Members)

If you are an administrator, you can invite other people to edit the website without them needing a GitHub account.

1.  Log in to the **Pages CMS Dashboard**.
2.  Click on the **Settings** icon (usually a gear ⚙️) in the sidebar.
3.  Go to the **"Collaborators"** or **"Users"** section.
4.  Click **"Invite"** or **"Add Member"**.
5.  Enter their **email address**. They will receive an email with a link to log in.


## 🖥️ The Interface

On the left sidebar, you will see a list of **Collections**. These are the different types of content you can edit:

*   **Home Page**: The main landing page.
*   **Research Page**: Research areas and descriptions.
*   **Publications**: List of papers, books, and software.
*   **Teaching**: Courses, seminars, and lecture notes.
*   **Members**: Profiles of current and former group members.
*   **Links Page**: Useful links for students and researchers.
*   **Contact Page**: Address, phone numbers, and email info.

## 💾 Saving and Publishing

When you make changes, they are not immediately visible to the public. You must **Save** and then **Publish** them.

1.  **Make your changes**: Edit text, upload images, etc.
2.  **Save**: Click the **"Save"** button (usually at the top right). This saves your changes as a "Draft" or "Commit".
3.  **Wait**: It may take a few minutes for the website to rebuild and show your changes live.

> **💡 Tip:** Always double-check your spelling and links before saving!

## 🖼️ Uploading Images and Files

*   When you see a field for an **Image** or **File**, you can click to upload a file from your computer.
*   The system will automatically put it in the correct folder.
*   **Important:** Try to use descriptive filenames (e.g., `max-mustermann-photo.jpg` instead of `IMG_1234.jpg`).
