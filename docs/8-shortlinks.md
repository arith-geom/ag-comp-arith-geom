# 8. Managing Shortlinks

The **Shortlinks** section allows you to create easy-to-remember URLs that automatically redirect to other pages (either on this website or external websites).

## 🔗 When to use Shortlinks?

*   **Sharing a paper**: Instead of creating a long link like `yoursite.com/publications/complex-title-of-paper-2024`, you can create `yoursite.com/paper2024`.
*   **Redirecting old pages**: If you change a URL, you can create a shortlink from the old address to the new one so links don't break.
*   **External links**: You can create `yoursite.com/zoom` that redirects to your Zoom meeting room.

## 📝 How to Create a Shortlink

1.  Open the **Shortlinks** collection in the sidebar.
2.  Click **"New Shortlinks"** (or similar button).
3.  **Short Slug**: Enter the short part of the URL you want.
    *   *Example*: `test` (this will create `yoursite.com/test`)
    *   *Note*: Do not include the domain name or slashes.
4.  **Target URL**: Enter where the user should go.
    *   *Internal*: `/publications/`
    *   *External*: `https://google.com`
5.  **Internal Note**: (Optional) Add a note for yourself about what this link is for.
6.  **Save** and **Publish**.

## ⚠️ Important Note

The redirect happens immediately when the user visits the page. They will barely notice the intermediate page.
